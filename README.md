# spotify_pitchfork_metadata
I created this code to write this [blog post](https://thesottovoce.wordpress.com/2016/03/26/am-i-a-pitchfork-guy/).

Use the Spotipy module (Spotify Web API wrapper) and a quick and dirty Pitchfork Scraper to get your music metadata!

It's not elegant, but it's functional. The documents in this repository are meant to help you set up a pandas DataFrame with:
  * Your Spotify Metadata
  * Pitchfork review scores for all albums which have existing reviews

I've included an example file should help you get your data quickly after registering your credentials through Spotify's API.

If you find this useful, please let me know! I'd love to see any work you produce.

Enjoy!
